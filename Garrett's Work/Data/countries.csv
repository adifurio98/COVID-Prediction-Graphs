Austria,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/austria/,"Once the center of power for the large Austro-Hungarian Empire, Austria was reduced to a small republic after its defeat in World War I. Following annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938 and subsequent occupation by the victorious Allies in 1945, Austria's status remained unclear for a decade. A State Treaty signed in 1955 ended the occupation, recognized Austria's independence, and forbade unification with Germany. A constitutional law that same year declared the country's ""perpetual neutrality"" as a condition for Soviet military withdrawal. The Soviet Union's collapse in 1991 and Austria's entry into the EU in 1995 have altered the meaning of this neutrality. A prosperous, democratic country, Austria entered the EU Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.","Central Europe, north of Italy and Slovenia","47 20 N, 13 20 E",Europe,"83,871 sq km","82,445 sq km","1,426 sq km",about the size of South Carolina; slightly more than two-thirds the size of Pennsylvania,"2,524 km",,0 km (landlocked),none (landlocked),"temperate; continental, cloudy; cold winters with frequent rain and some snow in lowlands and snow in mountains; moderate summers with occasional showers",mostly mountains (Alps) in the west and south; mostly flat or gently sloping along the eastern and northern margins,"Grossglockner 3,798 m",Neusiedler See 115 m,910 m,"oil, coal, lignite, timber, iron ore, copper, zinc, antimony, magnesite, tungsten, graphite, salt, hydropower",38.4% (2018 est.)arable land: 16.5% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 0.8% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 21.1% (2018 est.),47.2% (2018 est.),14.4% (2018 est.),"1,170 sq km (2012)",,"Danube (shared with Germany [s], Slovakia, Czechia, Hungary, Croatia, Serbia, Bulgaria, Ukraine, Moldova, and Romania [m]) - 2,888 km",– [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth,"Atlantic Ocean drainage: Rhine-Maas (198,735 sq km), (Black Sea) Danube (795,656 sq km)",the northern and eastern portions of the country are more densely populated; nearly two-thirds of the populace lives in urban areas,landslides; avalanches; earthquakes,"note 1: landlocked; strategic location at the crossroads of central Europe with many easily traversable Alpine passes and valleys; major river is the Danube; population is concentrated on eastern lowlands because of steep slopes, poor soils, and low temperatures elsewherenote 2: the world's largest and longest ice cave system at 42 km (26 mi) is the Eisriesenwelt (Ice Giants World) inside the Hochkogel mountain near Werfen, about 40 km south of Salzburg; ice caves are bedrock caves that contain year-round ice formations; they differ from glacial caves, which are transient and are formed by melting ice and flowing water within and under glaciers",Austria map showing major cities as well as parts of surrounding countries.,"8,913,088 (2022 est.)",Austrian(s),Austrian,"Austrian 80.8%, German 2.6%, Bosnian and Herzegovinian 1.9%, Turkish 1.8%, Serbian 1.6%, Romanian 1.3%, other 10% (2018 est.)","German (official nationwide) 88.6%, Turkish 2.3%, Serbian 2.2%, Croatian (official in Burgenland) 1.6%, other (includes Slovene, official in southern Carinthia, and Hungarian, official in Burgenland) 5.3% (2001 est.)","Das World Factbook, die unverzichtbare Quelle für grundlegende Informationen.

It is closely tied to other EU economies, especially Germany's, but also the US’, its third-largest trade partner. Its economy features a large service sector, a sound industrial sector, and a small, but highly developed agricultural sector.   Austrian economic growth strengthen in 2017, with a 2.9% increase in GDP. Austrian exports, accounting for around 60% of the GDP, were up 8.2% in 2017. Austria’s unemployment rate fell by 0.3% to 5.5%, which is low by European standards, but still at its second highest rate since the end of World War II, driven by an increased number of refugees and EU migrants entering the labor market.   Austria's fiscal position compares favorably with other euro-zone countries. The budget deficit stood at a low 0.7% of GDP in 2017 and public debt declined again to 78.4% of GDP in 2017, after reaching a post-war high 84.6% in 2015. The Austrian government has announced it plans to balance the fiscal budget in 2019. Several external risks, such as Austrian banks' exposure to Central and Eastern Europe, the refugee crisis, and continued unrest in Russia/Ukraine, eased in 2017, but are still a factor for the Austrian economy. Exposure to the Russian banking sector and a deep energy relationship with Russia present additional risks.   Austria elected a new pro-business government in October 2017 that campaigned on promises to reduce bureaucracy, improve public sector efficiency, reduce labor market protections, and provide positive investment incentives.",$463.12 billion (2020 est.)$495.8 billion (2019 est.)$488.86 billion (2018 est.),data are in 2017 dollars,1.42% (2019 est.)2.58% (2018 est.)2.4% (2017 est.),"$51,900 (2020 est.)$55,800 (2019 est.)$55,300 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,$445.025 billion (2019 est.),1.5% (2019 est.)2% (2018 est.)2% (2017 est.),1.3% (2017 est.),28.4% (2017 est.),70.3% (2017 est.),,52.1% (2017 est.),19.5% (2017 est.),23.5% (2017 est.),1.6% (2017 est.),54.2% (2017 est.),-50.7% (2017 est.),"milk, maize, sugar beet, wheat, barley, potatoes, pork, triticale, grapes, apples","construction, machinery, vehicles and parts, food, metals, chemicals, lumber and paper, electronics, tourism",6.5% (2017 est.),3.739 million (2020 est.),0.70%,25.20%,74.1% (2017 est.),7.35% (2019 est.)7.7% (2018 est.),10.50%,11.30%,9.5% (2020 est.),13.3% (2018 est.),29.7 (2017 est.)30.5 (2014),2.80%,23.5% (2012 est.),201.7 billion (2017 est.),204.6 billion (2017 est.),-0.7% (of GDP) (2017 est.),78.6% of GDP (2017 est.)83.6% of GDP (2016 est.),48.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),calendar year,$12.667 billion (2019 est.)$5.989 billion (2018 est.),$226.79 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$247.17 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$253.3 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,,"Germany 28%, United States 7%, Italy 6%, Switzerland 5% (2019)","cars, packaged medical supplies, vehicle parts, medical vaccines/cultures, flavored water (2019)",$211.85 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$232.8 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$238.79 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,"Germany 39%, Italy 7%, Czechia 5% (2019)","cars, vehicle parts, broadcasting equipment, refined petroleum, packaged medical supplies (2019)",$21.57 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$23.36 billion (31 December 2016 est.),$688.434 billion (2019 est.)$686.196 billion (2018 est.),euros (EUR) per US dollar -0.82771 (2020 est.)0.90338 (2019 est.)0.87789 (2018 est.)0.885 (2014 est.)0.7634 (2013 est.),100% (2020),,,28.376 million kW (2020 est.),"69,905,200,000 kWh (2020 est.)","22,918,265,000 kWh (2020 est.)",24.522 billion kWh (2020 est.),3.192 billion kWh (2020 est.),17.4% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),2.8% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),9.4% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),62.9% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),7.4% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),1.327 million metric tons (2020 est.),4.899 million metric tons (2020 est.),"1,000 metric tons (2020 est.)",3.667 million metric tons (2020 est.),0 metric tons (2019 est.),"20,100 bbl/day (2021 est.)","278,700 bbl/day (2019 est.)",0 barrels/day (2018 est.),"168,300 barrels/day (2018 est.)",35.2 million barrels (2021 est.),"186,500 bbl/day (2017 est.)","49,960 bbl/day (2017 est.)","135,500 bbl/day (2017 est.)",924.515 million cubic meters (2019 est.),"9,207,632,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","2,800,248,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","14,114,028,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",5.04 billion cubic meters (2021 est.),65.54 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),10.508 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),37.336 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),17.695 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),171.299 million Btu/person (2019 est.),"3,786,725 (2020 est.)",42 (2020 est.),"10,717,445 (2020 est.)",119 (2020 est.),"mature telecom market, dominated by Telekom Austria, Magenta Telekom (formed from the merger of T-Mobile Austria and the cableco UPC Austria), and 3 Austria;

Greece,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/greece/,"Greece achieved independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1830. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century, it gradually added neighboring islands and territories, most with Greek-speaking populations. In World War II, Greece was first invaded by Italy (1940) and subsequently occupied by Germany (1941-44); fighting endured in a protracted civil war between supporters of the king and other anti-communist and communist rebels. Following the latter's defeat in 1949, Greece joined NATO in 1952. In 1967, a group of military officers seized power, establishing a military dictatorship that suspended many political liberties and forced the king to flee the country. In 1974 following the collapse of the dictatorship, democratic elections and a referendum created a parliamentary republic and abolished the monarchy. In 1981, Greece joined the EC (now the EU); it became the 12th member of the European Economic and Monetary Union in 2001. Greece has suffered a severe economic crisis since late 2009, due to nearly a decade of chronic overspending and structural rigidities. Beginning in 2010, Greece entered three bailout agreements - the first two with the European Commission, the European Central Bank, and the IMF; and the third in 2015 with the European Stability Mechanism - worth in total about $300 billion. The Greek Government formally exited the third bailout in August 2018.","Southern Europe, bordering the Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea, and the Mediterranean Sea, between Albania and Turkey","39 00 N, 22 00 E",Europe,"131,957 sq km","130,647 sq km","1,310 sq km",slightly smaller than Alabama,"1,110 km",,"13,676 km",,"temperate; mild, wet winters; hot, dry summers",mountainous with ranges extending into the sea as peninsulas or chains of islands,"Mount Olympus 2,917",Mediterranean Sea 0 m,498 m,"lignite, petroleum, iron ore, bauxite, lead, zinc, nickel, magnesite, marble, salt, hydropower potential",63.4% (2018 est.)arable land: 19.7% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 8.9% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 34.8% (2018 est.),30.5% (2018 est.),6.1% (2018 est.),"15,550 sq km (2012)",,,,,one-third of the population lives in and around metropolitan Athens; the remainder of the country has moderate population density mixed with sizeable urban clusters,severe earthquakes,"strategic location dominating the Aegean Sea and southern approach to Turkish Straits; a peninsular country, possessing an archipelago of about 2,000 islands",Greece map showing major cities as well as parts of surrounding countries and water bodies.,"10,533,871 (2022 est.)",Greek(s),Greek,"Greek 91.6%, Albanian 4.4%, other 4% (2011 est.)","Greek (official) 99%, other (includes English and French) 1%","Το Παγκόσμιο Βιβλίο Δεδομένων, η απαραίτητη πηγή βασικών πληροφοριών.

Tourism provides 18% of GDP. Immigrants make up nearly one-fifth of the work force, mainly in agricultural and unskilled jobs. Greece is a major beneficiary of EU aid, equal to about 3.3% of annual GDP.   The Greek economy averaged growth of about 4% per year between 2003 and 2007, but the economy went into recession in 2009 as a result of the world financial crisis, tightening credit conditions, and Athens' failure to address a growing budget deficit. By 2013, the economy had contracted 26%, compared with the pre-crisis level of 2007. Greece met the EU's Growth and Stability Pact budget deficit criterion of no more than 3% of GDP in 2007-08, but violated it in 2009, when the deficit reached 15% of GDP. Deteriorating public finances, inaccurate and misreported statistics, and consistent underperformance on reforms prompted major credit rating agencies to downgrade Greece's international debt rating in late 2009 and led the country into a financial crisis. Under intense pressure from the EU and international market participants, the government accepted a bailout program that called on Athens to cut government spending, decrease tax evasion, overhaul the civil-service, health-care, and pension systems, and reform the labor and product markets. Austerity measures reduced the deficit to 1.3% in 2017. Successive Greek governments, however, failed to push through many of the most unpopular reforms in the face of widespread political opposition, including from the country's powerful labor unions and the general public.   In April 2010, a leading credit agency assigned Greek debt its lowest possible credit rating, and in May 2010, the IMF and euro-zone governments provided Greece emergency short- and medium-term loans worth $147 billion so that the country could make debt repayments to creditors. Greece, however, struggled to meet the targets set by the EU and the IMF, especially after Eurostat - the EU's statistical office - revised upward Greece's deficit and debt numbers for 2009 and 2010. European leaders and the IMF agreed in October 2011 to provide Athens a second bailout package of $169 billion. The second deal called for holders of Greek government bonds to write down a significant portion of their holdings to try to alleviate Greece’s government debt burden. However, Greek banks, saddled with a significant portion of sovereign debt, were adversely affected by the write down and $60 billion of the second bailout package was set aside to ensure the banking system was adequately capitalized.   In 2014, the Greek economy began to turn the corner on the recession. Greece achieved three significant milestones: balancing the budget - not including debt repayments; issuing government debt in financial markets for the first time since 2010; and generating 0.7% GDP growth — the first economic expansion since 2007.   Despite the nascent recovery, widespread discontent with austerity measures helped propel the far-left Coalition of the Radical Left (SYRIZA) party into government in national legislative elections in January 2015. Between January and July 2015, frustrations grew between the SYRIZA-led government and Greece’s EU and IMF creditors over the implementation of bailout measures and disbursement of funds. The Greek government began running up significant arrears to suppliers, while Greek banks relied on emergency lending, and Greece’s future in the euro zone was called into question. To stave off a collapse of the banking system, Greece imposed capital controls in June 2015, then became the first developed nation to miss a loan payment to the IMF, rattling international financial markets. Unable to reach an agreement with creditors, Prime Minister Alexios TSIPRAS held a nationwide referendum on 5 July on whether to accept the terms of Greece’s bailout, campaigning for the ultimately successful ""no"" vote. The TSIPRAS government subsequently agreed, however, to a new $96 billion bailout in order to avert Greece’s exit from the monetary bloc. On 20 August 2015, Greece signed its third bailout, allowing it to cover significant debt payments to its EU and IMF creditors and to ensure the banking sector retained access to emergency liquidity. The TSIPRAS government — which retook office on 20 September 2015 after calling new elections in late August — successfully secured disbursal of two delayed tranches of bailout funds. Despite the economic turmoil, Greek GDP did not contract as sharply as feared, boosted in part by a strong tourist season.   In 2017, Greece saw improvements in GDP and unemployment. Unfinished economic reforms, a massive non-performing loan problem, and ongoing uncertainty regarding the political direction of the country hold the economy back.

India,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/india/,"The Indus Valley civilization, one of the world's oldest, flourished during the 3rd and 2nd millennia B.C. and extended into northwestern India. Aryan tribes from the northwest infiltrated the Indian subcontinent about 1500 B.C.; their merger with the earlier Dravidian inhabitants created the classical Indian culture. The Maurya Empire of the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C. - which reached its zenith under ASHOKA - united much of South Asia. The Golden Age ushered in by the Gupta dynasty (4th to 6th centuries A.D.) saw a flowering of Indian science, art, and culture. Islam spread across the subcontinent over a period of 700 years. In the 10th and 11th centuries, Turks and Afghans invaded India and established the Delhi Sultanate. In the early 16th century, the Emperor BABUR established the Mughal Dynasty, which ruled India for more than three centuries. European explorers began establishing footholds in India during the 16th century. By the 19th century, Great Britain had become the dominant political power on the subcontinent and India was seen as the ""Jewel in the Crown"" of the British Empire. The British Indian Army played a vital role in both World Wars. Years of nonviolent resistance to British rule, led by Mohandas GANDHI and Jawaharlal NEHRU, eventually resulted in Indian independence in 1947. Large-scale communal violence took place before and after the subcontinent partition into two separate states - India and Pakistan. The neighboring countries have fought three wars since independence, the last of which was in 1971 and resulted in East Pakistan becoming the separate nation of Bangladesh. India's nuclear weapons tests in 1998 emboldened Pakistan to conduct its own tests that same year. In November 2008, terrorists originating from Pakistan conducted a series of coordinated attacks in Mumbai, India's financial capital. India's economic growth following the launch of economic reforms in 1991, a massive youthful population, and a strategic geographic location have contributed to India's emergence as a regional and global power. However, India still faces pressing problems such as environmental degradation, extensive poverty, and widespread corruption, and its restrictive business climate challenges economic growth expectations.","Southern Asia, bordering the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal, between Burma and Pakistan","20 00 N, 77 00 E",Asia,"3,287,263 sq km","2,973,193 sq km","314,070 sq km",slightly more than one-third the size of the US,"13,888 km","Bangladesh 4,142 km; Bhutan 659 km; Burma 1,468 km; China 2,659 km; Nepal 1,770 km; Pakistan 3,190 km","7,000 km",,varies from tropical monsoon in south to temperate in north,"upland plain (Deccan Plateau) in south, flat to rolling plain along the Ganges, deserts in west, Himalayas in north","Kanchenjunga 8,586 m",Indian Ocean 0 m,160 m,"coal (fourth-largest reserves in the world), antimony, iron ore, lead, manganese, mica, bauxite, rare earth elements, titanium ore, chromite, natural gas, diamonds, petroleum, limestone, arable land",60.5% (2018 est.)arable land: 52.8% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 4.2% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 3.5% (2018 est.),23.1% (2018 est.),16.4% (2018 est.),"667,000 sq km (2012)","Chilika Lake - 1,170 sq km","Brahmaputra (shared with China [s] and Bangladesh [m]) - 3,969 km; Indus (shared with China [s] and Pakistan [m]) - 3,610 km; Ganges river source (shared with Bangladesh [m]) - 2,704 km; Godavari - 1,465 km; Sutlej (shared with China [s] and Pakistan [m]) - 1,372 km; Yamuna - 1,370 km; Narmada - 1,289 km; Chenab river source (shared with Pakistan [m]) - 1,086 km; Ghaghara river mouth (shared with China [s] and Nepal) - 1,080 km",– [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth,"Indian Ocean drainage: Brahmaputra (651,335 sq km), Ganges (1,016,124 sq km), Indus (1,081,718 sq km), Irrawaddy (413,710 sq km)","with the notable exception of the deserts in the northwest, including the Thar Desert, and the mountain fringe in the north, a very high population density exists throughout most of the country; the core of the population is in the north along the banks of the Ganges, with other river valleys and southern coastal areas also having large population concentrations","droughts; flash floods, as well as widespread and destructive flooding from monsoonal rains; severe thunderstorms; earthquakes","dominates South Asian subcontinent; near important Indian Ocean trade routes; Kanchenjunga, third tallest mountain in the world, lies on the border with Nepal",India map showing major cities as well as parts of surrounding countries and the Indian Ocean.,"1,389,637,446 (2022 est.)",Indian(s),Indian,"Indo-Aryan 72%, Dravidian 25%, and other 3% (2000)","Hindi 43.6%, Bengali 8%, Marathi 6.9%, Telugu 6.7%, Tamil 5.7%, Gujarati 4.6%, Urdu 4.2%, Kannada 3.6%, Odia 3.1%, Malayalam 2.9%, Punjabi 2.7%, Assamese 1.3%, Maithili 1.1%, other 5.6%; note - English enjoys the status of subsidiary official language but is the most important language for national, political, and commercial communication; there are 22 other officially recognized languages: Assamese, Bengali, Bodo, Dogri, Gujarati, Hindi, Kannada, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Malayalam, Manipuri, Nepali, Odia, Punjabi, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu; Hindustani is a popular variant of Hindi/Urdu spoken widely throughout northern India but is not an official language (2011 est.)","विश्व फ़ैक्टबुक, आधारभूत जानकारी का एक अपरिहार्य स्त्रोत  (Hindi)The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.",,,"Hindu 79.8%, Muslim 14.2%, Christian 2.3%, Sikh 1.7%, other and unspecified 2% (2011 est.)","26.31% (male 185,017,089/female 163,844,572)","17.51% (male 123,423,531/female 108,739,780)","41.56% (male 285,275,667/female 265,842,319)","7.91% (male 52,444,817/female 52,447,038)","6.72% (2020 est.)

Slightly less than half of the workforce is in agriculture, but services are the major source of economic growth, accounting for nearly two-thirds of India's output but employing less than one-third of its labor force. India has capitalized on its large educated English-speaking population to become a major exporter of information technology services, business outsourcing services, and software workers. Nevertheless, per capita income remains below the world average. India is developing into an open-market economy, yet traces of its past autarkic policies remain. Economic liberalization measures, including industrial deregulation, privatization of state-owned enterprises, and reduced controls on foreign trade and investment, began in the early 1990s and served to accelerate the country's growth, which averaged nearly 7% per year from 1997 to 2017.   India's economic growth slowed in 2011 because of a decline in investment caused by high interest rates, rising inflation, and investor pessimism about the government's commitment to further economic reforms and about slow world growth. Investors’ perceptions of India improved in early 2014, due to a reduction of the current account deficit and expectations of post-election economic reform, resulting in a surge of inbound capital flows and stabilization of the rupee. Growth rebounded in 2014 through 2016. Despite a high growth rate compared to the rest of the world, India’s government-owned banks faced mounting bad debt, resulting in low credit growth. Rising macroeconomic imbalances in India and improving economic conditions in Western countries led investors to shift capital away from India, prompting a sharp depreciation of the rupee through 2016.   The economy slowed again in 2017, due to shocks of ""demonetizaton"" in 2016 and introduction of GST in 2017. Since the election, the government has passed an important goods and services tax bill and raised foreign direct investment caps in some sectors, but most economic reforms have focused on administrative and governance changes, largely because the ruling party remains a minority in India’s upper house of Parliament, which must approve most bills.   India has a young population and corresponding low dependency ratio, healthy savings and investment rates, and is increasing integration into the global economy.

Indonesia,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/indonesia/,"The archipelago was once largely under the control of Buddhist and Hindu rulers. By around the 7th century, a Buddhist kingdom arose on Sumatra and expanded into Java and the Malay Peninsula until it was conquered in the late 13th century by the Hindu Majapahit Empire from Java. Majapahit (1290-1527) united most of modern-day Indonesia and Malaysia. Traders introduced Islam in the trade ports around the 11th century, and Indonesians gradually adopted Islam over the next 500 years. The Portuguese conquered parts of Indonesia in the 16th century, but they were ousted by the Dutch (except in East Timor), who began colonizing the islands in the early 17th century. It would be the early 20th century before Dutch colonial rule was established across the entirety of what would become the boundaries of the modern Indonesian state.Japan occupied the islands from 1942 to 1945. Indonesia declared its independence shortly before Japan's surrender, but it required four years of sometimes brutal fighting, intermittent negotiations, and UN mediation before the Netherlands agreed to transfer sovereignty in 1949. A period of sometimes unruly parliamentary democracy ended in 1957 when President SOEKARNO declared martial law and instituted ""Guided Democracy."" After an abortive coup in 1965 by alleged communist sympathizers, SOEKARNO was gradually eased from power. From 1967 until 1998, President SUHARTO ruled Indonesia with his ""New Order"" government. After street protests toppled SUHARTO in 1998, free and fair legislative elections took place in 1999. Indonesia is now the world's third most populous democracy, the world's largest archipelagic state, and the world's largest Muslim-majority nation. Current issues include: alleviating poverty, improving education, preventing terrorism, consolidating democracy after four decades of authoritarianism, implementing economic and financial reforms, stemming corruption, reforming the criminal justice system, addressing climate change, and controlling infectious diseases, particularly those of global and regional importance. In 2005, Indonesia reached a historic peace agreement with armed separatists in Aceh. Indonesia continues to face low intensity armed resistance in Papua by the separatist Free Papua Movement.","Southeastern Asia, archipelago between the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean","5 00 S, 120 00 E",Southeast Asia,"1,904,569 sq km","1,811,569 sq km","93,000 sq km",slightly less than three times the size of Texas,"2,958 km",,"54,716 km",,"tropical; hot, humid; more moderate in highlands",mostly coastal lowlands; larger islands have interior mountains,"Puncak Jaya 4,884 m",Indian Ocean 0 m,367 m,"petroleum, tin, natural gas, nickel, timber, bauxite, copper, fertile soils, coal, gold, silver",31.2% (2018 est.)arable land: 13% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 12.1% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 6.1% (2018 est.),51.7% (2018 est.),17.1% (2018 est.),"67,220 sq km (2012)",,"Sepik (shared with Papua New Guinea [s]) - 1,126 km; Fly (shared with Papua New Guinea [s]) - 1,050 km",– [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth,,"major concentration on the island of Java, which is considered one of the most densely populated places on earth; of the outer islands (those surrounding Java and Bali), Sumatra contains some of the most significant clusters, particularly in the south near the Selat Sunda, and along the northeastern coast near Medan; the cities of Makasar (Sulawesi), Banjarmasin (Kalimantan) are also heavily populated",occasional floods; severe droughts; tsunamis; earthquakes; volcanoes; forest fires ,,Indonesia map showing major cities and islands of this archipelagic country as well as parts of surrounding countries.  ,"277,329,163 (2022 est.)",Indonesian(s),Indonesian,"Javanese 40.1%, Sundanese 15.5%, Malay 3.7%, Batak 3.6%, Madurese 3%, Betawi 2.9%, Minangkabau 2.7%, Buginese 2.7%, Bantenese 2%, Banjarese 1.7%, Balinese 1.7%, Acehnese 1.4%, Dayak 1.4%, Sasak 1.3%, Chinese 1.2%, other 15% (2010 est.)","Bahasa Indonesia (official, modified form of Malay), English, Dutch, local dialects (of which the most widely spoken is Javanese); note - more than 700 languages are used in Indonesia","Fakta Dunia, sumber informasi dasar yang sangat diperlukan.

During the global financial crisis, Indonesia outperformed its regional neighbors and joined China and India as the only G20 members posting growth. Indonesia’s annual budget deficit is capped at 3% of GDP, and the Government of Indonesia lowered its debt-to-GDP ratio from a peak of 100% shortly after the Asian financial crisis in 1999 to 34% today. In May 2017 Standard & Poor’s became the last major ratings agency to upgrade Indonesia’s sovereign credit rating to investment grade.   Poverty and unemployment, inadequate infrastructure, corruption, a complex regulatory environment, and unequal resource distribution among its regions are still part of Indonesia’s economic landscape. President Joko WIDODO - elected in July 2014 – seeks to develop Indonesia’s maritime resources and pursue other infrastructure development, including significantly increasing its electrical power generation capacity. Fuel subsidies were significantly reduced in early 2015, a move which has helped the government redirect its spending to development priorities.

The fertility decline slowed in the late 1990’s when responsibility for family planning programs shifted to the district level, where the programs were not prioritized.  Since 2012 the national government revitalized the national family planning program, and Indonesia’s TFR has slowly decreased to 2.3 in 2020.  The government may reach its goal of achieving replacement level fertility – 2.1 children per woman – but the large number of women of childbearing age ensures significant population growth for many years.  Indonesia is a source country for labor migrants, a transit country for asylum seekers, and a destination mainly for highly skilled migrant workers.  International labor migration, both legal and illegal, from Indonesia to other parts of Asia (most commonly Malaysia) and the Middle East has taken place for decades because of high unemployment and underemployment, poverty, and low wages domestically.  Increasing numbers of migrant workers are drawn to Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the US.  The majority of Indonesian labor migration is temporary and consists predominantly of low-skilled workers, mainly women working as domestics.

Iran,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/iran/,"Known as Persia until 1935, Iran became an Islamic republic in 1979 after the ruling monarchy was overthrown and Shah Mohammad Reza PAHLAVI was forced into exile. Conservative clerical forces led by Ayatollah Ruhollah KHOMEINI established a theocratic system of government with ultimate political authority vested in a learned religious scholar referred to commonly as the Supreme Leader who, according to the constitution, is accountable only to the Assembly of Experts - a popularly elected 88-member body of clerics. US-Iranian relations became strained when a group of Iranian students seized the US Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held embassy personnel hostages until mid-January 1981. The US cut off diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980. During the period 1980-88, Iran fought a bloody, indecisive war with Iraq that eventually expanded into the Persian Gulf and led to clashes between US Navy and Iranian military forces. Iran has been designated a state sponsor of terrorism and was subject to US, UN, and EU economic sanctions and export controls because of its continued involvement in terrorism and concerns over possible military dimensions of its nuclear program until Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) Implementation Day in 2016. The US began gradually re-imposing sanctions on Iran after the US withdrawal from JCPOA in May 2018. Following the election of reformer Hojjat ol-Eslam Mohammad KHATAMI as president in 1997 and a reformist Majles (legislature) in 2000, a campaign to foster political reform in response to popular dissatisfaction was initiated. The movement floundered as conservative politicians, supported by the Supreme Leader, unelected institutions of authority like the Council of Guardians, and the security services reversed and blocked reform measures while increasing security repression. Starting with nationwide municipal elections in 2003 and continuing through Majles elections in 2004, conservatives reestablished control over Iran's elected government institutions, which culminated with the August 2005 inauguration of hardliner Mahmud AHMADI-NEJAD as president. His controversial reelection in June 2009 sparked nationwide protests over allegations of electoral fraud, but the protests were quickly suppressed. Deteriorating economic conditions due primarily to government mismanagement and international sanctions prompted at least two major economically based protests in July and October 2012, but Iran's internal security situation remained stable. President AHMADI-NEJAD's independent streak angered regime establishment figures, including the Supreme Leader, leading to conservative opposition to his agenda for the last year of his presidency, and an alienation of his political supporters. In June 2013, Iranians elected a centrist cleric Dr. Hasan Fereidun RUHANI to the presidency. A longtime senior member in the regime, he made promises of reforming society and Iran's foreign policy. In July 2015, Iran and the five permanent members, plus Germany (P5+1) signed the JCPOA under which Iran agreed to restrictions on its nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief; however, the US reimposed sanctions in 2018 dealing a blow to RUHANI's legacy and the Iranian economy. Negotiations to restore the deal started in 2021 and are ongoing. Iran held elections in February 2020 for the Majles and the president in June 2021, resulting in a hardline and conservative monopoly across the regime's elected and unelected institutions. President Ebrahim RAISI is a hardline cleric with a decades-long career in Iran's judiciary and has had limited foreign policy and economic experience.","Middle East, bordering the Gulf of Oman, the Persian Gulf, and the Caspian Sea, between Iraq and Pakistan","32 00 N, 53 00 E",Middle East,"1,648,195 sq km","1,531,595 sq km","116,600 sq km",almost 2.5 times the size of Texas; slightly smaller than Alaska,"5,894 km",,"2,440 km - note: Iran also borders the Caspian Sea (740 km)",,"mostly arid or semiarid, subtropical along Caspian coast","rugged, mountainous rim; high, central basin with deserts, mountains; small, discontinuous plains along both coasts","Kuh-e Damavand 5,625 m",Caspian Sea -28 m,"1,305 m","petroleum, natural gas, coal, chromium, copper, iron ore, lead, manganese, zinc, sulfur",30.1% (2018 est.)arable land: 10.8% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 1.2% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 18.1% (2018 est.),6.8% (2018 est.),63.1% (2018 est.),"95,530 sq km (2012)","Caspian Sea (shared with Russia, Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, and Kazakhstan) - 374,000 sq km; Lake Urmia - 5,200 sq km; Lake Namak - 750 sq km","Euphrates (shared with Turkey [s], Syria, and Iraq [m]) - 3,596 km; Tigris (shared with Turkey, Syria, and Iraq [m]) - 1,950 km; Helmand (shared with Afghanistan [s]) - 1,130 km",– [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth,"Indian Ocean drainage: (Persian Gulf) Tigris and Euphrates (918,044 sq km)","population is concentrated in the north, northwest, and west, reflecting the position of the Zagros and Elburz Mountains; the vast dry areas in the center and eastern parts of the country, around the deserts of the Dasht-e Kavir and Dasht-e Lut, have a much lower population density","periodic droughts, floods; dust storms, sandstorms; earthquakes","strategic location on the Persian Gulf and Strait of Hormuz, which are vital maritime pathways for crude oil transport",Iran map showing major cities as well as parts of surrounding countries and the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman.,"86,758,304 (2022 est.)",Iranian(s),Iranian,"Persian, Azeri, Kurd, Lur, Baloch, Arab, Turkmen, and Turkic tribes","Persian Farsi (official), Azeri and other Turkic dialects, Kurdish, Gilaki and Mazandarani, Luri, Balochi, Arabic","چکیده نامه جهان، منبعی ضروری برای کسب اطلاعات کلی جهان (Persian)The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.",,,"Muslim (official) 99.6% (Shia 90-95%, Sunni 5-10%), other (includes Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian) 0.3%, unspecified 0.2% (2016 est.)","24.11% (male 10,472,844/female 10,000,028)","13.36% (male 5,806,034/female 5,537,561)","48.94% (male 21,235,038/female 20,327,384)","7.72% (male 3,220,074/female 3,337,420)","5.87% (2020 est.)

The Iranian government directly owns and operates hundreds of state-owned enterprises and indirectly controls many companies affiliated with the country's security forces. Distortions - including corruption, price controls, subsidies, and a banking system holding billions of dollars of non-performing loans - weigh down the economy, undermining the potential for private-sector-led growth.   Private sector activity includes small-scale workshops, farming, some manufacturing, and services, in addition to medium-scale construction, cement production, mining, and metalworking. Significant informal market activity flourishes and corruption is widespread.   The lifting of most nuclear-related sanctions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in January 2016 sparked a restoration of Iran’s oil production and revenue that drove rapid GDP growth, but economic growth declined in 2017 as oil production plateaued. The economy continues to suffer from low levels of investment and declines in productivity since before the JCPOA, and from high levels of unemployment, especially among women and college-educated Iranian youth.   In May 2017, the re-election of President Hasan RUHANI generated widespread public expectations that the economic benefits of the JCPOA would expand and reach all levels of society. RUHANI will need to implement structural reforms that strengthen the banking sector and improve Iran’s business climate to attract foreign investment and encourage the growth of the private sector. Sanctions that are not related to Iran’s nuclear program remain in effect, and these—plus fears over the possible re-imposition of nuclear-related sanctions—will continue to deter foreign investors from engaging with Iran.","$1,044,310,000,000 (2020 est.)$1,027,240,000,000 (2019 est.)$1.102 trillion (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,3.7% (2017 est.)12.5% (2016 est.)-1.6% (2015 est.),"$12,400 (2020 est.)$12,400 (2019 est.)$13,500 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,$581.252 billion (2019 est.),10% (2017 est.)9.6% (2017 est.)9.1% (2016 est.),9.6% (2016 est.),35.3% (2016 est.),55% (2017 est.),,49.7% (2017 est.),14% (2017 est.),20.6% (2017 est.),14.5% (2017 est.),26% (2017 est.),-24.9% (2017 est.),"wheat, sugar cane, milk, sugar beet, tomatoes, barley, potatoes, oranges, poultry, apples","petroleum, petrochemicals, gas, fertilizer, caustic soda, textiles, cement and other construction materials, food processing (particularly sugar refining and vegetable oil production), ferrous and nonferrous metal fabrication, armaments",3% (2017 est.),30.5 million (2017 est.),16.30%,35.10%,48.6% (2013 est.),11.8% (2017 est.)12.4% (2016 est.),23.70%,21.20%,36% (2020 est.),18.7% (2007 est.),40.8 (2017 est.),2.60%,29.6% (2005),74.4 billion (2017 est.),84.45 billion (2017 est.),-2.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),39.5% of GDP (2017 est.)47.5% of GDP (2016 est.),17.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),21 March - 20 March,$9.491 billion (2017 est.)$16.28 billion (2016 est.),$101.4 billion (2017 est.)$83.98 billion (2016 est.),,"China 48%, India 12%, South Korea 8%, Turkey 6%, United Arab Emirates 5% (2019)","crude petroleum, polymers, industrial alcohols, iron, pistachios (2019)",$76.39 billion (2017 est.)$63.14 billion (2016 est.),"China 28%, United Arab Emirates 20%, India 11%, Turkey 7%, Brazil 6%, Germany 5% (2019)","rice, corn, broadcasting equipment, soybean products, beef (2019)",$120.6 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$133.7 billion (31 December 2016 est.),$7.995 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$8.196 billion (31 December 2016 est.),"Iranian rials (IRR) per US dollar -32,769.7 (2017 est.)30,914.9 (2016 est.)30,914.9 (2015 est.)29,011.5 (2014 est.)25,912 (2013 est.)",100% (2020),,,80.553 million kW (2020 est.),"279,826,390,000 kWh (2019 est.)",6.365 billion kWh (2019 est.),2.738 billion kWh (2019 est.),34.303 billion kWh (2019 est.),88.7% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),1.9% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0.1% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),9.1% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),2.783 million metric tons (2020 est.),2.794 million metric tons (2020 est.),"76,000 metric tons (2020 est.)","87,000 metric tons (2020 est.)",1.203 billion metric tons (2019 est.),"3,450,300 bbl/day (2021 est.)",1.934 million bbl/day (2019 est.),"2,230,900 barrels/day (2018 est.)","33,500 barrels/day (2018 est.)",208.6 billion barrels (2021 est.),1.764 million bbl/day (2015 est.),"397,200 bbl/day (2015 est.)","64,160 bbl/day (2015 est.)","237,561,415,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","220,704,282,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","17,607,046,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","1,153,457,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","33,987,296,000,000 cubic meters (2021 est.)",646.038 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),5.142 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),204.21 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),436.687 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),145.54 million Btu/person (2019 est.),"29,093,587 (2020 est.)",35 (2020 est.),"127,624,951 (2020 est.)",152 (2020 est.),"Iran’s telecom infrastructure has suffered from sanctions in recent years, which prevented the import of equipment and devices and encouraged widespread smuggling, with a consequent loss of tax revenue;

Italy,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/italy/,"Italy became a nation-state in 1861 when the regional states of the peninsula, along with Sardinia and Sicily, were united under King Victor EMMANUEL II. An era of parliamentary government came to a close in the early 1920s when Benito MUSSOLINI established a Fascist dictatorship. His alliance with Nazi Germany led to Italy's defeat in World War II. A democratic republic replaced the monarchy in 1946 and economic revival followed. Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community (EEC) and its subsequent successors the EC and the EU. It has been at the forefront of European economic and political unification, joining the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999.

The Italian economy is driven in large part by the manufacture of high-quality consumer goods produced by small and medium-sized enterprises, many of them family-owned. Italy also has a sizable underground economy, which by some estimates accounts for as much as 17% of GDP. These activities are most common within the agriculture, construction, and service sectors.   Italy is the third-largest economy in the euro zone, but its exceptionally high public debt and structural impediments to growth have rendered it vulnerable to scrutiny by financial markets. Public debt has increased steadily since 2007, reaching 131% of GDP in 2017. Investor concerns about Italy and the broader euro-zone crisis eased in 2013, bringing down Italy's borrowing costs on sovereign government debt from euro-era records. The government still faces pressure from investors and European partners to sustain its efforts to address Italy's longstanding structural economic problems, including labor market inefficiencies, a sluggish judicial system, and a weak banking sector. Italy’s economy returned to modest growth in late 2014 for the first time since 2011. In 2015-16, Italy’s economy grew at about 1% each year, and in 2017 growth accelerated to 1.5% of GDP. In 2017, overall unemployment was 11.4%, but youth unemployment remained high at 37.1%. GDP growth is projected to slow slightly in 2018.","$2,322,140,000,000 (2020 est.)$2,548,190,000,000 (2019 est.)$2,540,890,000,000 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,0.34% (2019 est.)0.83% (2018 est.)1.73% (2017 est.),"$39,000 (2020 est.)$42,700 (2019 est.)$42,100 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,"$2,002,763,000,000 (2019 est.)",0.6% (2019 est.)1.1% (2018 est.)1.2% (2017 est.),2.1% (2017 est.),23.9% (2017 est.),73.9% (2017 est.),,61% (2017 est.),18.6% (2017 est.),17.5% (2017 est.),-0.2% (2017 est.),31.4% (2017 est.),-28.3% (2017 est.),"milk, grapes, wheat, maize, tomatoes, apples, olives, sugar beet, oranges, rice","tourism, machinery, iron and steel, chemicals, food processing, textiles, motor vehicles, clothing, footwear, ceramics",2.1% (2017 est.),22.92 million (2020 est.),3.90%,28.30%,67.8% (2011),9.88% (2019 est.)10.63% (2018 est.),29.40%,27.90%,31.8% (2020 est.),20.1% (2018 est.),35.9 (2017 est.)27.3 (1995),2.30%,26.8% (2000),903.3 billion (2017 est.),948.1 billion (2017 est.),-2.3% (of GDP) (2017 est.),131.8% of GDP (2017 est.)132% of GDP (2016 est.),46.6% (of GDP) (2017 est.),calendar year,$59.517 billion (2019 est.)$51.735 billion (2018 est.),$558.26 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$636.01 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$656.06 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,,"Germany 12%, France 11%, United States 10%, United Kingdom 5%, Spain 5%, Switzerland 5% (2019)","packaged medicines, cars and vehicle parts, refined petroleum, valves, trunks/cases, wine (2019)",$486.35 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$569.7 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$605.44 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,"Germany 16%, France 9%, China 7%, Spain 5%, Netherlands 5%, Belgium 5% (2019)","crude petroleum, cars, packaged medicines, natural gas, refined petroleum (2019)",$151.2 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$130.6 billion (31 December 2015 est.),"$2,463,208,000,000 (2019 est.)$2,533,153,000,000 (2018 est.)",euros (EUR) per US dollar -0.82771 (2020 est.)0.90338 (2019 est.)0.87789 (2018 est.)0.885 (2014 est.)0.7634 (2013 est.),100% (2020),,,121.442 million kW (2020 est.),286.375 billion kWh (2020 est.),7.587 billion kWh (2020 est.),39.787 billion kWh (2020 est.),17.702 billion kWh (2020 est.),55.9% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),9.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),6.9% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),17.5% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),2.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),8.1% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),1.456 million metric tons (2020 est.),9.335 million metric tons (2020 est.),"368,000 metric tons (2020 est.)",8.235 million metric tons (2020 est.),17 million metric tons (2019 est.),"107,700 bbl/day (2021 est.)","1,255,100 bbl/day (2019 est.)","10,100 barrels/day (2018 est.)",1.253 million barrels/day (2018 est.),497.9 million barrels (2021 est.),1.607 million bbl/day (2017 est.),"615,900 bbl/day (2017 est.)","422,500 bbl/day (2017 est.)","3,888,491,000 cubic meters (2020 est.)","74,313,109,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",314.656 million cubic meters (2020 est.),"70,908,014,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",45.76 billion cubic meters (2021 est.),332.041 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),27.194 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),162.472 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),142.375 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),112.606 million Btu/person (2019 est.),"19,607,341 (2020 est.)",32 (2020 est.),"77,581,048 (2020 est.)",128 (2020 est.),"Italy’s large telecom market has one of the most progressive fiber sectors in Europe, with regulatory measures encouraging network sharing;

Mexico,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/mexico/,"The site of several advanced Amerindian civilizations - including the Olmec, Toltec, Teotihuacan, Zapotec, Maya, and Aztec - Mexico was conquered and colonized by Spain in the early 16th century. Administered as the Viceroyalty of New Spain for three centuries, it achieved independence early in the 19th century. Elections held in 2000 marked the first time since the 1910 Mexican Revolution that an opposition candidate - Vicente FOX of the National Action Party (PAN) - defeated the party in government, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He was succeeded in 2006 by another PAN candidate Felipe CALDERON, but Enrique PENA NIETO regained the presidency for the PRI in 2012. Left-leaning anti-establishment politician and former mayor of Mexico City (2000-05) Andres Manuel LOPEZ OBRADOR, from the National Regeneration Movement (MORENA), became president in December 2018.The global financial crisis in late 2008 caused a massive economic downturn in Mexico the following year. Growth rebounded to about 5% in 2010, but then averaged roughly half that for the rest of the decade. Notwithstanding this challenge, Mexico is currently the largest goods trading partner of the US – with $614.5 billion in two-way goods trade during 2019. US exports of goods and services to Mexico supported 1.2 million jobs in the US in 2015 (the latest data available) according to estimates from the Department of Commerce. Mexico's GDP contracted by 8.2% in 2020 due to pandemic-induced closures, its lowest level since the Great Depression, but Mexico’s economy rebounded in 2021 when it grew by 4.8%, driven largely by increased remittances, despite supply chain and pandemic-related challenges. The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA, or T-MEC by its Spanish acronym) entered into force on 1 July 2020 and replaced its predecessor, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Mexico amended its constitution on 1 May 2019 to facilitate the implementation of the labor components of USMCA. Ongoing economic and social concerns include low real wages, high underemployment, inequitable income distribution, and few advancement opportunities for the largely indigenous population in the impoverished southern states. Since 2007, Mexico's powerful transnational criminal organizations have engaged in a struggle to control criminal markets, resulting in tens of thousands of drug-related homicides and forced disappearances.","North America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, between Belize and the United States and bordering the North Pacific Ocean, between Guatemala and the United States","23 00 N, 102 00 W",North America,"1,964,375 sq km","1,943,945 sq km","20,430 sq km",slightly less than three times the size of Texas,"4,389 km",,"9,330 km",,varies from tropical to desert,"high, rugged mountains; low coastal plains; high plateaus; desert","Volcan Pico de Orizaba 5,636 m",Laguna Salada -10 m,"1,111 m","petroleum, silver, antimony, copper, gold, lead, zinc, natural gas, timber",54.9% (2018 est.)arable land: 11.8% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 1.4% (2018 est.)permanent pasture: 41.7% (2018 est.),33.3% (2018 est.),11.8% (2018 est.),"65,000 sq km (2012)","Laguna de Terminos - 1,550 sq km","Rio Grande river mouth (shared with US [s]) - 3,057 km; Colorado river mouth (shared with US [s]) - 2,333 km",– [s] after country name indicates river source; [m] after country name indicates river mouth,"Atlantic Ocean drainage: (Gulf of Mexico) Rio Grande/Bravo (607,965 sq km)Pacific Ocean drainage: (Gulf of California) Colorado (703,148 sq km)",most of the population is found in the middle of the country between the states of Jalisco and Veracruz; approximately a quarter of the population lives in and around Mexico City,"tsunamis along the Pacific coast, volcanoes and destructive earthquakes in the center and south, and hurricanes on the Pacific, Gulf of Mexico, and Caribbean coasts",,Mexico map showing major cities as well as parts of surrounding countries and bodies of water.,"129,150,971 (2022 est.)",Mexican(s),Mexican,"Mestizo (Amerindian-Spanish) 62%, predominantly Amerindian 21%, Amerindian 7%, other 10% (mostly European) (2012 est.)","Spanish only 93.8%, Spanish and indigenous languages 5.4%, indigenous only 0.6%, unspecified 0.2%; note - indigenous languages include various Mayan, Nahuatl, and other regional languages (2020 est.)","La Libreta Informativa del Mundo, la fuente indispensable de información básica.

Per capita income is roughly one-third that of the US; income distribution remains highly unequal.   Mexico has become the US' second-largest export market and third-largest source of imports. In 2017, two-way trade in goods and services exceeded $623 billion. Mexico has free trade agreements with 46 countries, putting more than 90% of its trade under free trade agreements. In 2012, Mexico formed the Pacific Alliance with Peru, Colombia, and Chile.   Mexico's current government, led by President Enrique PENA NIETO, has emphasized economic reforms, passing and implementing sweeping energy, financial, fiscal, and telecommunications reform legislation, among others, with the long-term aim to improve competitiveness and economic growth across the Mexican economy. Since 2015, Mexico has held public auctions of oil and gas exploration and development rights and for long-term electric power generation contracts. Mexico has also issued permits for private sector import, distribution, and retail sales of refined petroleum products in an effort to attract private investment into the energy sector and boost production.   Since 2013, Mexico’s economic growth has averaged 2% annually, falling short of private-sector expectations that President PENA NIETO’s sweeping reforms would bolster economic prospects. Growth is predicted to remain below potential given falling oil production, weak oil prices, structural issues such as low productivity, high inequality, a large informal sector employing over half of the workforce, weak rule of law, and corruption. Mexico’s economy remains vulnerable to uncertainty surrounding the future of NAFTA — because the United States is its top trading partner and the two countries share integrated supply chains — and to potential shifts in domestic policies following the inauguration of a new a president in December 2018.","$2,306,320,000,000 (2020 est.)$2,513,410,000,000 (2019 est.)$2,514,780,000,000 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,-0.3% (2019 est.)2.19% (2018 est.)2.34% (2017 est.),"$17,900 (2020 est.)$19,700 (2019 est.)$19,900 (2018 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,"$1,269,956,000,000 (2019 est.)",3.6% (2019 est.)4.9% (2018 est.)6% (2017 est.),3.6% (2017 est.),31.9% (2017 est.),64.5% (2017 est.),,67% (2017 est.),11.8% (2017 est.),22.3% (2017 est.),0.8% (2017 est.),37.8% (2017 est.),-39.7% (2017 est.),"sugarcane, maize, milk, oranges, sorghum, tomatoes, poultry, wheat, green chillies/peppers, eggs","food and beverages, tobacco, chemicals, iron and steel, petroleum, mining, textiles, clothing, motor vehicles, consumer durables, tourism",-0.6% (2017 est.),50.914 million (2020 est.),13.40%,24.10%,61.9% (2011),3.49% (2019 est.)3.33% (2018 est.),8.10%,7.80%,8.7% (2020 est.),41.9% (2018 est.),36.8 (2018 est.)48.3 (2008),2%,40% (2014),261.4 billion (2017 est.),273.8 billion (2017 est.),-1.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.),54.3% of GDP (2017 est.)56.8% of GDP (2016 est.),22.7% (of GDP) (2017 est.),calendar year,-$4.351 billion (2019 est.)-$25.415 billion (2018 est.),$434.93 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$492.73 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$480.1 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,,United States 75% (2019),"cars and vehicle parts, computers, delivery trucks, crude petroleum, insulated wiring (2019)",$410.66 billion (2020 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$495.79 billion (2019 est.) note: data are in current year dollars$505.05 billion (2018 est.) note: data are in current year dollars,"United States 54%, China 14% (2019)","integrated circuits, refined petroleum, cars and vehicle parts, office machinery/parts, telephones (2019)",$175.3 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$178.4 billion (31 December 2016 est.),$456.713 billion (2019 est.)$448.268 billion (2018 est.),Mexican pesos (MXN) per US dollar -19.8 (2020 est.)19.22824 (2019 est.)20.21674 (2018 est.)15.848 (2014 est.)13.292 (2013 est.),100% (2020),,,93.43 million kW (2020 est.),267.34 billion kWh (2020 est.),5.954 billion kWh (2020 est.),9.965 billion kWh (2020 est.),42.121 billion kWh (2020 est.),75.7% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),3.6% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),4.4% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),6.5% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),7.6% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),1.5% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0.8% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),9.886 million metric tons (2020 est.),10.241 million metric tons (2020 est.),"3,000 metric tons (2020 est.)",5.182 million metric tons (2020 est.),1.211 billion metric tons (2019 est.),"1,905,500 bbl/day (2021 est.)","1,928,800 bbl/day (2019 est.)","1,283,300 barrels/day (2018 est.)","3,900 barrels/day (2018 est.)","5,786,100,000 barrels (2021 est.)","844,600 bbl/day (2017 est.)","155,800 bbl/day (2017 est.)","867,500 bbl/day (2017 est.)","27,037,730,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)","86,101,223,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",53.037 million cubic meters (2019 est.),"59,119,362,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",180.321 billion cubic meters (2021 est.),463.739 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),43.24 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),260.311 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),160.188 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),61.597 million Btu/person (2019 est.),"24,500,456 (2020 est.)",19 (2020 est.),"122,898,392 (2020 est.)",95 (2020 est.),"with a large population and relatively low broadband and mobile penetration, (86 lines for mobile broadband for every 100 habitants in June 2021) Mexico’s telecom sector has potential for growth;

Over the following two decades, successive governments privatized many state-controlled firms and liberalized key areas of the economy, including the financial and telecommunications sectors. The country joined the Economic and Monetary Union in 1999 and began circulating the euro on 1 January 2002 along with 11 other EU members.   The economy grew by more than the EU average for much of the 1990s, but the rate of growth slowed in 2001-08. After the global financial crisis in 2008, Portugal’s economy contracted in 2009 and fell into recession from 2011 to 2013, as the government implemented spending cuts and tax increases to comply with conditions of an EU-IMF financial rescue package, signed in May 2011. Portugal successfully exited its EU-IMF program in May 2014, and its economic recovery gained traction in 2015 because of strong exports and a rebound in private consumption. GDP growth accelerated in 2016, and probably reached 2.5 % in 2017. Unemployment remained high, at 9.7% in 2017, but has improved steadily since peaking at 18% in 2013.   The center-left minority Socialist government has unwound some unpopular austerity measures while managing to remain within most EU fiscal targets. The budget deficit fell from 11.2% of GDP in 2010 to 1.8% in 2017, the country’s lowest since democracy was restored in 1974, and surpassing the EU and IMF projections of 3%.

Taiwan,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/taiwan/,"First inhabited by Austronesian people, Taiwan became home to Han immigrants beginning in the late Ming Dynasty (17th century). In 1895, military defeat forced China's Qing Dynasty to cede Taiwan to Japan, which then governed Taiwan for 50 years. Taiwan came under Chinese Nationalist (Kuomintang, KMT) control after World War II. With the communist victory in the Chinese civil war in 1949, the Nationalist-controlled Republic of China government and 2 million Nationalists fled to Taiwan and continued to claim to be the legitimate government for mainland China and Taiwan based on a 1947 Constitution drawn up for all of China. Until 1987, however, the Nationalist government ruled Taiwan under a civil war martial law declaration dating to 1948. Beginning in the 1970s, Nationalist authorities gradually began to incorporate the native population into the governing structure beyond the local level. The democratization process expanded rapidly in the 1980s, leading to the then illegal founding of Taiwan’s first opposition party (the Democratic Progressive Party or DPP) in 1986 and the lifting of martial law the following year. Taiwan held legislative elections in 1992, the first in over forty years, and its first direct presidential election in 1996. In the 2000 presidential elections, Taiwan underwent its first peaceful transfer of power with the KMT loss to the DPP and afterwards experienced two additional democratic transfers of power in 2008 and 2016. Throughout this period, the island prospered, became one of East Asia's economic ""Tigers,"" and after 2000 became a major investor in mainland China as cross-Strait ties matured. The dominant political issues continue to be economic reform and growth as well as management of sensitive relations between Taiwan and China.","Eastern Asia, islands bordering the East China Sea, Philippine Sea, South China Sea, and Taiwan Strait, north of the Philippines, off the southeastern coast of China","23 30 N, 121 00 E",Southeast Asia,"35,980 sq km","32,260 sq km","3,720 sq km",slightly smaller than Maryland and Delaware combined,0 km,,"1,566.3 km",,tropical; marine; rainy season during southwest monsoon (June to August); persistent and extensive cloudiness all year,eastern two-thirds mostly rugged mountains; flat to gently rolling plains in west,"Yu Shan 3,952 m",South China Sea 0 m,"1,150 m","small deposits of coal, natural gas, limestone, marble, asbestos, arable land",22.7% (2018 est.)arable land: 16.9% (2018 est.)permanent crops: 5.8% (2018 est.),,77.3% (2018 est.),"3,820 sq km (2012)",,,,,"distribution exhibits a peripheral coastal settlement pattern, with the largest populations on the north and west coasts",earthquakes; typhoons,strategic location adjacent to both the Taiwan Strait and the Luzon Strait,Taiwan map showing major cities of this island in the Western Pacific Ocean.,"23,580,712 (2022 est.)",Taiwan (singular and plural),Taiwan (or Taiwanese),"Han Chinese (including Holo, who compose approximately 70% of Taiwan's population, Hakka, and other groups originating in mainland China) more than 95%, indigenous Malayo-Polynesian peoples 2.3%","Mandarin (official), Taiwanese (Min Nan), Hakka dialects, approximately 16 indigenous languages","世界概況  –  不可缺少的基本消息來源 (Mandarin)The World Factbook, the indispensable source for basic information.",,,"Buddhist 35.3%, Taoist 33.2%, Christian 3.9%, folk religion (includes Confucian) approximately 10%, none or unspecified 18.2% (2005 est.)","12.42% (male 1,504,704/female 1,426,494)","11.62% (male 1,403,117/female 1,339,535)","45.51% (male 5,351,951/female 5,389,112)","14.73% (male 1,698,555/female 1,778,529)","15.72% (2020 est.)

the ""National Banner Song"" has gained popularity in Taiwan and is commonly used during flag raisings",,,"Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy that is driven largely by industrial manufacturing, and especially exports of electronics, machinery, and petrochemicals. This heavy dependence on exports exposes the economy to fluctuations in global demand. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, low birth rate, rapidly aging population, and increasing competition from China and other Asia Pacific markets are other major long-term challenges.   Following the landmark Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement (ECFA) signed with China in June 2010, Taiwan in July 2013 signed a free trade deal with New Zealand - Taipei’s first-ever with a country with which it does not maintain diplomatic relations - and, in November of that year, inked a trade pact with Singapore. However, follow-on components of the ECFA, including a signed agreement on trade in services and negotiations on trade in goods and dispute resolution, have stalled. In early 2014, the government bowed to public demand and proposed a new law governing the oversight of cross-Strait agreements, before any additional deals with China are implemented; the legislature has yet to vote on such legislation, leaving the future of ECFA uncertain. President TSAI since taking office in May 2016 has promoted greater economic integration with South and Southeast Asia through the New Southbound Policy initiative and has also expressed interest in Taiwan joining the Trans-Pacific Partnership as well as bilateral trade deals with partners such as the US. These overtures have likely played a role in increasing Taiwan’s total exports, which rose 11% during the first half of 2017, buoyed by strong demand for semiconductors.   Taiwan's total fertility rate of just over one child per woman is among the lowest in the world, raising the prospect of future labor shortages, falling domestic demand, and declining tax revenues. Taiwan's population is aging quickly, with the number of people over 65 expected to account for nearly 20% of the island's total population by 2025.   The island runs a trade surplus with many economies, including China and the US, and its foreign reserves are the world's fifth largest, behind those of China, Japan, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland. In 2006, China overtook the US to become Taiwan's second-largest source of imports after Japan. China is also the island's number one destination for foreign direct investment. Taiwan since 2009 has gradually loosened rules governing Chinese investment and has also secured greater market access for its investors on the mainland. In August 2012, the Taiwan Central Bank signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cross-Strait currency settlement with its Chinese counterpart. The MOU allows for the direct settlement of Chinese renminbi (RMB) and the New Taiwan dollar across the Strait, which has helped Taiwan develop into a local RMB hub.   Closer economic links with the mainland bring opportunities for Taiwan’s economy but also pose challenges as political differences remain unresolved and China’s economic growth is slowing. President TSAI’s administration has made little progress on the domestic economic issues that loomed large when she was elected, including concerns about stagnant wages, high housing prices, youth unemployment, job security, and financial security in retirement. TSAI has made more progress on boosting trade with South and Southeast Asia, which may help insulate Taiwan’s economy from a fall in mainland demand should China’s growth slow in 2018.","$1,143,277,000,000 (2019 est.)$1,113,126,000,000 (2018 est.)$1,083,384,000,000 (2017 est.)",data are in 2010 dollars,2.71% (2019 est.)2.75% (2018 est.)3.31% (2017 est.),"$24,502 (2018 est.)$50,500 (2017 est.)$23,865 (2017 est.)",data are in 2017 dollars,$611.391 billion (2019 est.),0.5% (2019 est.)1.3% (2018 est.)0.6% (2017 est.),1.8% (2017 est.),36% (2017 est.),62.1% (2017 est.),,53% (2017 est.),14.1% (2017 est.),20.5% (2017 est.),-0.2% (2017 est.),65.2% (2017 est.),-52.6% (2017 est.),"rice, vegetables, pork, cabbages, poultry, sugar cane, milk, eggs, pineapples, tropical fruit","electronics, communications and information technology products, petroleum refining, chemicals, textiles, iron and steel, machinery, cement, food processing, vehicles, consumer products, pharmaceuticals",3.9% (2017 est.),11.498 million (2020 est.),4.90%,35.90%,59.2% (2016 est.),3.73% (2019 est.)3.69% (2018 est.),,,,1.5% (2012 est.),33.6 (2014)32.6 (2000),6.4% (2010),40.3% (2010),91.62 billion (2017 est.),92.03 billion (2017 est.),-0.1% (of GDP) (2017 est.),35.7% of GDP (2017 est.)36.2% of GDP (2016 est.),16% (of GDP) (2017 est.),calendar year,$65.173 billion (2019 est.)$70.843 billion (2018 est.),$388.49 billion (2019 est.)$383.484 billion (2018 est.)$382.736 billion (2017 est.),,"China 26%, United States 14%, Hong Kong 12%, Japan 7%, Singapore 7%, South Korea 5% (2019)","integrated circuits, office machinery/parts, computers, refined petroleum, liquid crystal displays (2019)",$308.744 billion (2019 est.)$305.428 billion (2018 est.)$303.067 billion (2017 est.),"China 21%, Japan 16%, United States 11%, South Korea 6% (2019)","integrated circuits, crude petroleum, photography equipment, natural gas, refined petroleum (2019)",$456.7 billion (31 December 2017 est.)$439 billion (31 December 2016 est.),$189.684 billion (2019 est.)$196.276 billion (2018 est.),New Taiwan dollars (TWD) per US dollar -28.211 (2020 est.)30.472 (2019 est.)30.8395 (2018 est.)31.911 (2014 est.)30.363 (2013 est.),,,,57.738 million kW (2020 est.),"269,570,325,000 kWh (2020 est.)",0 kWh (2020 est.),0 kWh (2020 est.),9.484 billion kWh (2020 est.),82.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),11.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),2.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0.9% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),2.2% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),0% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),1.3% of total installed capacity (2020 est.),5.955 million metric tons (2020 est.),67.985 million metric tons (2020 est.),"118,000 metric tons (2020 est.)",63.523 million metric tons (2020 est.),1 million metric tons (2019 est.),800 bbl/day (2021 est.),"998,100 bbl/day (2019 est.)",0 barrels/day (2018 est.),"886,200 barrels/day (2018 est.)",2.4 million barrels (2021 est.),"924,000 bbl/day (2015 est.)","349,600 bbl/day (2015 est.)","418,300 bbl/day (2015 est.)",150.589 million cubic meters (2019 est.),"22,002,493,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",0 cubic meters (2021 est.),"22,172,507,000 cubic meters (2019 est.)",6.23 billion cubic meters (2021 est.),279.206 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),141.445 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),92.207 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),45.554 million metric tonnes of CO2 (2019 est.),160.669 million Btu/person (2019 est.),"12,971,900 (2019 est.)",55 (2019 est.),"29,291,500 (2019)",123.21 (2019),"dynamic telecommunications industry defined by excellent infrastructure and competitive mobile market;

Thailand,https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/thailand/,"Two unified Thai kingdoms emerged in the mid-13th century. The Sukhothai, located in the south-central plains, gained its independence from the Khmer empire to the east. By the late 13th century, Sukhothai’s territory extended into present-day Burma and Laos. Sukhotai lasted until the mid-15th century. The Thai Lan Na kingdom was established in the north with its capital at Chang Mai. Lan Na was conquered by the Burmese in the 16th century. The Ayutthaya kingdom (14th-18th centuries) succeeded the Sukhothai and would become known as the Siamese Kingdom. During the Ayutthaya period, the Thai/Siamese peoples consolidated their hold on what is present-day central and north-central Thailand. Following a military defeat at the hands of the Burmese in 1767, the Siamese Kingdom rose to new heights under the military ruler TAKSIN, who defeated the Burmese occupiers and expanded the kingdom’s territory into modern-day northern Thailand (formerly the Lan Na kingdom), Cambodia, Laos, and the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom fought off additional Burmese invasions and raids in the late 1700s and early 1800s. In the mid-1800s, Western pressure led to Siam signing trade treaties that reduced the country’s sovereignty and independence. In the 1890s and 1900s, the British and French forced the kingdom to cede Cambodian, Laotian, and Malay territories that had been under Siamese control. A bloodless revolution in 1932 led to the establishment of a constitutional monarchy. After the Japanese invaded Thailand in 1941, the government split into a pro-Japan faction and a pro-Ally faction backed by the king. Following the war, Thailand became a US treaty ally in 1954 after sending troops to Korea and later fighting alongside the US in Vietnam. Thailand since 2005 has experienced several rounds of political turmoil including a military coup in 2006 that ousted then Prime Minister THAKSIN Chinnawat, followed by large-scale street protests by competing political factions in 2008, 2009, and 2010. THAKSIN's youngest sister, YINGLAK Chinnawat, in 2011 led the Puea Thai Party to an electoral win and assumed control of the government. In early May 2014, after months of large-scale anti-government protests in Bangkok beginning in November 2013, YINGLAK was removed from office by the Constitutional Court and in late May 2014 the Royal Thai Army, led by Royal Thai Army Gen. PRAYUT Chan-ocha, staged a coup against the caretaker government. The military-affiliated National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), led by PRAYUT as the appointed minister, ruled the country for more than four years, during which time the NCPO drafted a new constitution guaranteeing military sway over Thai politics in future elections by allowing the military to appoint the entire 250 member Senate and requiring a joint meeting of the House and Senate to select the prime minister, effectively giving the military a veto over the top executive. King PHUMIPHON Adunyadet passed away in October 2016 after 70 years on the throne; his only son, WACHIRALONGKON Bodinthrathepphayawarangkun (aka King Rama X), ascended the throne in December 2016.

most Thai ideally want one child of each sex. Because of its low fertility rate, increasing life expectancy, and growing elderly population, Thailand has become an aging society that will face growing labor shortages.  The proportion of the population under 15 years of age has shrunk dramatically, the proportion of working-age individuals has peaked and is starting to decrease, and the proportion of elderly is growing rapidly.  In the short-term, Thailand will have to improve educational quality to increase the productivity of its workforce and to compete globally in skills-based industries.  An increasing reliance on migrant workers will be necessary to mitigate labor shortfalls. Thailand is a destination, transit, and source country for migrants. It has 3-4 million migrant workers as of 2017, mainly providing low-skilled labor in the construction, agriculture, manufacturing, services, and fishing and seafood processing sectors.  Migrant workers from other Southeast Asian countries with lower wages – primarily Burma and, to a lesser extent, Laos and Cambodia – have been coming to Thailand for decades to work in labor-intensive industries.  Many are undocumented and are vulnerable to human trafficking for forced labor, especially in the fisheries industry, or sexual exploitation.  A July 2017 migrant worker law stiffening fines on undocumented workers and their employers, prompted tens of thousands of migrants to go home.  Fearing a labor shortage, the Thai Government has postponed implementation of the law until January 2018 and is rapidly registering workers.  Thailand has also hosted ethnic minority refugees from Burma for more than 30 years; as of 2016, approximately 105,000 mainly Karen refugees from Burma were living in nine camps along the Thailand-Burma border. Thailand has a significant amount of internal migration, most often from rural areas to urban centers, where there are more job opportunities.  Low- and semi-skilled Thais also go abroad to work, mainly in Asia and a smaller number in the Middle East and Africa, primarily to more economically developed countries where they can earn higher wages.","5,128,993 tons (2012 est.)",19.1% (2012 est.),,,"data cover general government debt and include debt instruments issued (or owned) by government entities other than the treasury; the data include treasury debt held by foreign entities; the data include debt issued by subnational entities, as well as intragovernmental debt; intragovernmental debt consists of treasury borrowings from surpluses in the social funds, such as for retirement, medical care, and unemployment; debt instruments for the social funds are sold at public auctions","4,043 km (2017) 1.000-m gauge",,200 nm,,,,,,,,similar to the flag of Costa Rica but with the blue and red colors reversed,BBB+ (2013),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Laem Chabang (8,106,928) (2019)",Map Ta Phut,275 South Sudan (UNMISS) (Feb 2022),"PRAYUT Chan-ocha was appointed interim prime minister in August 2014, three months after he staged the coup that removed the previously elected government of Prime Minister YINGLAK Chinnawat; on 5 June 2019 PRAYUT (independent) was approved as prime minister by the parliament",,,,,,,,,,,,,Chiang Mai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
